# Neuro-Genomics Final Project
**Avital Markus & Noa Cohen**

## Part 1 — Bulk RNA-seq
Differential expression analysis between control and knockout mouse cortex tissue.
Kallisto (quantification) → pyDESeq2 (DE analysis) → g:Profiler (enrichment).

## Part 2 — Single-cell In Situ Sequencing
Cell type annotation and spatial analysis of a breast cancer biopsy to predict
PD-L1 immunotherapy response using Scanpy.

## Files
- `part1.ipynb` — bulk RNA-seq notebook
- `part2.ipynb` — single-cell notebook
- `part1/` — gene counts and DESeq2 results
- `part2/` — expression matrix, cell locations, marker genes
